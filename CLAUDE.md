# Learn — personal learning app (Ollie, SBI student → robotics)

One shared knowledge graph across CS/math/physics/engineering/robotics. MVP: full CS skill tree + module 1 "How Computers Work" fully playable. Long-term: every domain grows to FULL bachelor's-degree depth (one graph, cross-subject links), robotics as the converging goal.

Project lives at `~/Claude/Projects/Learning website` (moved from "GSP IoT" — open sessions HERE).

## Stack
Vite + React + TS · Tailwind v4 (@tailwindcss/vite, no config file) · zustand+persist (one versioned localStorage blob) · @xyflow/react (skill tree AND gate sandbox) · motion (unlock/completion animations only). No backend, no router.

## Layout
- `src/types.ts` — ALL types (KnowledgeNode, Screen union, Progress)
- `src/content/curriculum.ts` — knowledge graph, hand-authored x/y positions
- `src/content/lessons/*.ts` — one file per lesson node
- `src/components/` — SkillTreeView, LessonPlayer, GateSandbox, screen components
- `src/store.ts` — zustand store; node status (locked/available/mastered) computed via selector, never stored

## Screen union (discriminated on `kind`)
`explain` | `predict {question, options, reveal}` | `quiz {question, options, correctIndex, explanations[]}` | `gatePuzzle {puzzleId}` | `sandbox {presetId?}`

## Pedagogy (non-negotiable — this IS the product)
1. Max ~3 sentences prose before the learner must DO something.
2. Predict → observe → explain before any sim reveals a result.
3. Quizzes answered from memory; every wrong option gets a specific misconception explanation.
4. Mastery gating: unlock = prereqs mastered (lesson done + quiz ≥ 80%). Locked nodes visible+titled.
5. Worked-example fading: full example → completion step → independent.
6. XP only for mastery. No streaks/leagues. Celebrate unlocks with animation.
7. Every concept: one-line real-world/robotics hook (whyItMatters).

## Conventions
- Extend working files; small targeted diffs; one game = one file with `{ onComplete(score) }`.
- Content ONLY in src/content — components never hardcode lesson text.
- Definition of done per phase: `npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit` clean, git commit.
- Node.js lives at `~/.local/node/bin` (not on default PATH) — prepend `export PATH="$HOME/.local/node/bin:$PATH"` in shell commands.
- NOTE: `npx tsc --noEmit` alone does NOT catch errors (root tsconfig only references projects) — the real check is `npm run build` (runs `tsc -b`).
- Dark theme, vivid accent per subject: cs=cyan, math=violet, physics=amber, engineering=emerald, robotics=rose.
- The `sandbox` Screen kind is defined but unused so far (adder lessons used gatePuzzles + games instead); free-play sandbox is a future feature.

## Deploy (manual — gh CLI not installed)
1. Create an empty repo on github.com (e.g. `learning-website`, private is fine). No README/gitignore.
2. In `~/Claude/Projects/Learning website`:
   `git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/learning-website.git && git push -u origin main`
   (or `master` — check `git branch`).
3. On vercel.com: Add New → Project → import the repo. Vercel auto-detects Vite. Build command `npm run build`, output `dist` (defaults). Deploy.
4. Every future `git push` auto-deploys.

## Next
- Ollie tests P4 (adder + CPU lessons) end-to-end in browser.
- Deploy via the manual steps above (or install `gh` + `brew` first).
- Then: content for remaining nodes (start with Programming Fundamentals or Robotics Bridge), free-play sandbox preset support, possibly extract lesson-generation prompt template so an AI tutor can emit new lesson files.
